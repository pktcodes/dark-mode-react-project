# Dark Mode ðŸŒ“
> PROD [Live] : https://react-dark-mode-prod.netlify.app/

#### Dark Mode consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a
- Blog with a list of static text posts, navbar with a title *Overreacted* and a **Toggle** button.
- Toggle button has the functionality to switch between the **light** and **dark** modes of the blog on click.
- By default, the site is set to a light theme with a `background: white`, `font: black and a dark shade of pink`. When switched to a dark theme using the toggle, colors are changed to `background: black`,  `font: white and a light shade of pink` for a flexible user experience.
- **Local Storage** has been implemented to remember the mode of theme the user has been using. So, when the user revisits the site or on page reloads the mode of theme is still saved up.
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm start` to start up the development server on default port 3000.
